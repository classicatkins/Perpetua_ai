        <img class="img-about" src="img/melissa-circle.png" alt="photo of melissa">
        <p>As a passionate and dedicated Full Stack Developer at Sketch Development Services, I specialize in creating innovative software solutions. Currently, I am contributing to development in Time Front, a key project utilizing technologies such as MongoDB, Vue, TypeScript, Playwright, and JavaScript. My role in this Agile environment involves not only coding but also contributing to the continuous improvement of our software, ensuring both efficiency and user satisfaction.</p>

        <p>At Murray State University, where I earned a bachelor's degree in Music Education with a minor in Computer Science, I laid the foundation of my technical expertise. Beyond practical programming in Java, JavaScript, and C++, my studies delved into essential computer science concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming, Algorithms, and Data Structures. This rigorous academic training honed my analytical skills and provided a strong theoretical understanding that underpins my practical work.</p>

        <p>I am committed to continuous learning and currently enhancing my skill set through the Savvy Coders' Full Stack Web Development course. Here, I am gaining hands-on experience in building advanced web applications using Node.js and JavaScript, further broadening my expertise in the field.</p>

        <p>I am keen on exploring new opportunities in technology that challenge me and allow me to contribute to innovative solutions. Letâ€™s connect to discuss how we can collaborate to drive technological advancement and innovation!</p>
